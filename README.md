# Virtual-CT-Scanner
This project will be based on a Virtual Computed Tomography (CT) Scanner to replicate the image formation and reconstruction process in the CT imaging.The simulator will enable the users to learn the impact of acquisition parameters like detector spacing, number of projections and source distance on the quality of the image.
